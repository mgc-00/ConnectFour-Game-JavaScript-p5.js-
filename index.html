         * Connect Four Game
         * 
         * A simple implementation of the Connect Four game where a player competes 
         * against a computer. The player drops red pieces and the computer drops yellow
         * pieces in a grid. The goal is to connect four of your pieces in a row, either
         * horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
         * 
         * Game Features:
         * - Player vs Computer: The player (red) faces off against a simple AI (yellow).
         * - Interactive Game Board: Click on columns to drop your pieces into the board.
         * - Win Detection: Checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.
         * - Responsive UI: The game adapts to different screen sizes.
         * ver 1.0
         * Developed with p5.js.
